## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring developer from the UK who loves to learn and contribute toward an open source future.

At the minute, I am working on various TypeScript projects for @TheCodingDen, including moderation and community management tools / systems.
I am also learning more about fullstack web development, including using non-JS languages such as Rust through WASM.

In the future, I want to learn more about data analysis and visualisation with modern technologies such as Polars.
Looking to get into the backend development space ðŸ‘€.
